# `physicsfront.mqca`

This package provides high level modules written on top of
`physicsfront.qiskit` and IBM `qiskit`.

Acronym MQCA means &ldquo;making quantum computing accessible&rdquo;, which
is the goal of this package.  Different from the more technical packages such
as IBM `qiskit` or  `physicsfront.qiskit`, this package aims to provide high
level quantum computing modules that are readily applicable to quantum
computational experimentation through which quantum computing concepts can be
grapsed and learned through concrete experimental results.

## Installation

`pip install physicsfront-mqca`
