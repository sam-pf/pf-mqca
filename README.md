# `physicsfront.mqca`

This package provides high level modules written on top of
`physicsfront.qiskit` and IBM `qiskit`.

Acronym MQCA means &ldquo;making quantum computing accessible,&rdquo; which
is the goal of this package.  Based on the more technically oriented packages
such as `physicsfront.qiskit` or IBM `qiskit`, this package aims to provide
high level quantum computing modules that are readily applicable to quantum
computational experimentation.  Concrete results that such experimentation
yields at user's control can help make difficult quantum computing concepts
more real and easier to grasp.

## Installation

`pip install physicsfront-mqca`
